                        Ramadan is also the month of tagines. We serve tagines almost daily and women usually rotate between red meat, poultry, fish, and vegetarian tagines for more diversity. If you have a clay tagine pot at home, then I highly recommend this

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Oussama Bouhidi (AKA Odlan) and I'm a 19-year-old student studying in FSBM. I'm currently pursuing a degree in SMAI, which is short for "Mathematics and Computer Science".I've always had a passion for learning about how things work and how to create something from scratch, which is why I decided to pursue a degree in this field. I'm also learning programming on my own and enjoy building websites like this one. In my free time, I love reading manga and watching anime. I've been a fan of manga for as long as I can remember, and I've always been fascinated by the way the art and storytelling can come together to create amazing stories. In fact, I love manga so much that I even have a MyAnimeList page where I keep track of all the series I've read! you can check <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Odlan" target="_blank">my MAL page</a> if you want.</p>
            <p>
                Aside from manga, I also enjoy playing basketball and practicing my programming skills. I'm still relatively new to programming, but I'm excited to continue learning and expanding my skill set. Ultimately, my goal is to use my knowledge and skills to create something that can positively impact the world around me.
            </p>
            <p>This is a simple website I made to practice my web development skills. I hope you find it useful or interesting and thanks for taking the time to read a bit about me!</p>
