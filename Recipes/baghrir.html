               <br><p>Growing up in Morocco, Moroccan pancakes – Baghrir or Beghrir in Moroccan  – were my favorite crepes to eat. The fluffiness and lightness of these semolina pancakes are so addictive while their honeycomb texture with multiples holes allows for a perfect absorption of honey-and-butter toppings.

                    The good thing about Moroccan pancakes is that they are easy to make and they require very few and simple ingredients that you can easily find online. But I will lie to you if I said there are the easiest to make. In fact, there are a few secret tips that every Moroccan cook follows to have a successful batch of delicious Baghrir. Keep reading.

            <h2>How to Make Successful Moroccan Baghrir Pancakes</h2>

                    The first pancake secret that our mothers teach us in Morocco is the following: Moroccan pancakes should be cooked in a non-stick frying pan that has never been in contact with oil or grease. This might seem odd to you but this is actually the most important step to make successful Baghrir and one of the most common reasons why Beghrir recipes can fail.
                </p>
               <br><p>
                    In every Moroccan house, there is one nonstick frying pan that is used only for making Baghrir pancakes. I have one that I use to make Baghrir, but also to make regular American pancakes which I cook without greasing the surface. So if possible, get a new frying pan and only use it for making pancakes.
                </p>
               <br><p>
                    The second important tip to make Moroccan semolina pancakes is to have a batter – not too liquid and not too thick – with small little bubbles. This is achieved by mixing the ingredients in a blender at high speed for at least one minute. Then let the batter rest for 45 minutes to 1 hour until it doubles in volume and you have more bubbles on the surface
                </p>
               <br><p>
                    That’s it. That all you need to know to make these mouth-melting and fluffy Moroccan Baghrir pancakes.
